## Data Visualization
Data visualization refers to the graphical depiction of information and data. Data visualization tools use visual components such as charts, graphs, and maps to make trends, outliers, and patterns in data more visible and understandable. Furthermore, it allows employees or business owners to convey facts to non-technical audiences without confusion. Data visualization tools and technology are critical in Big Data analysis and decision-making.

The advantages of data visualization:
- Information can be easily shared.
- Explore options in an interactive way.
- Visualize the patterns and correlations.

The disadvantages of data visualization:
- Biased or incorrect information.
- Correlation does not always indicate causality.
- Core messages can become lost in translation.

## CRISP-DM
CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a cyclical process that provides a structured approach to planning, organizing, and implementing a data mining project. The process consists of six major phases:

### 1. Business Understanding
It has a quite vital part. Business understanding requires knowledge of the business objects, how to build or obtain data, and how to match modeling goals to business goals; so that the best model can be built. Activities carried out include: define business objectives, assessing the current scenario, setting data mining targets, and creating a project plan. 

### 2. Data Understanding
Data understanding provides the analytical foundation for a study by creating a summary and identifying potential problems in the data. It must also be carried out carefully and not in a rush, such as in data visualization, where sometimes the insight is very difficult to obtain when connected to the summary data. If there are problems at this step that have not been answered, it will interfere with the modeling step.

### 3. Data Preparation
The data is rarely clean. Data preparation focuses on cleaning and translating raw data into a modelable format. It includes: selecting data, cleaning data, constructing data (feature engineering), integrating data, and formatting data.

### 4. Modeling
With clean data at hand, numerous modeling strategies are used. Each approach may require specialized data formats, so it is not uncommon to return to the data preparation phase. Key activities include: selecting modeling techniques, designing tests, building the model, and evaluating the model.

### 5. Evaluation
Evaluation is used to analyze the outcomes of data mining generated during the preceding stage of the modeling process. This is done on the model used in the previous step, with the goal of ensuring that the model determined is consistent with the objectives set in the first step.

### 6. Deployment
The model is finally deployed in a real-world situation. This might be as easy as creating a report or as complicated as establishing a repeatable data mining process. The key activities include planning deployment, monitoring and maintenance, reviewing the project, and completing the project.
