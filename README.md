## Data Visualization
Data visualization refers to the graphical depiction of information and data. Data visualization tools use visual components such as charts, graphs, and maps to make trends, outliers, and patterns in data more visible and understandable. Furthermore, it allows employees or business owners to convey facts to non-technical audiences without confusion. Data visualization tools and technology are critical in Big Data analysis and decision-making.

4 characteristics called ACES:
- Accurate
 The visualization should accurately depict the data and its trends.
- Clear
 Your visualization should be simple to grasp.
- Empowering
 The reader should know what to do after viewing your depiction.
- Succinct
 Your message should resonate quickly.

The advantages of data visualization:
- Information can be easily shared.
- Explore options in an interactive way.
- Visualize the patterns and correlations.

The disadvantages of data visualization:
- Biased or incorrect information.
- Correlation does not always indicate causality.
- Core messages can become lost in translation.

### Basic of Visualization
#### 1. Comparison
The term "comparison" refers to **comparing various variables in datasets or categories within one variable**. This can be demonstrated using bar charts, line graphs, or other comparison visualization methods.

Example:
- bar chart can compare exam scores between two classes in the school
- line graph can compare a variable between two groups over time

Types of Comparison Chart:
- Among Categories
  
  a) Bar chart vertical

#### 2. Composition
Composition is the representation of **one or more variables in absolute numbers and normalized forms**. This can be visualized using pie charts or stacked bar charts. While pie charts are considered outdated, they can nonetheless provide data in a visually pleasing and familiar way.

Types of Composition Chart:
- Changing Over Time
  
  a) Stacked bar chart
  
  <img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/933052ec-e166-4423-9bba-abde683f0a33" width="400" height="290">

  b) Stacked 100% bar chart

#### 3. Relationship
A relationship is the **connection between two or more variables**. A decent visualization can help identify these links without requiring sophisticated statistical analysis.

Example:

A graph can be used to depict the link between a tree's height and age
#### 4. Spatial
Spatial data charts, commonly called maps, are useful tools for **displaying and evaluating geographic data**. It is offer a strong method of showing data in a way that facilitates the analysis and identification of patterns, correlations, and trends. Users may readily determine where specific occurrences or phenomena are taking place and how they are spread throughout a geographical region. This is especially beneficial for examining data on population, demography, climate, and natural resources, among other topics.
## CRISP-DM
CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a cyclical process that provides a structured approach to planning, organizing, and implementing a data mining project. The process consists of six major phases:

<img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/3ef18b7f-1cdb-45fa-886d-069d9fcc253b" width="400" height="320">

### 1. Business Understanding
It has a quite vital part. Business understanding requires knowledge of the business objects, how to build or obtain data, and how to match modeling goals to business goals; so that the best model can be built. Activities carried out include: define business objectives, assessing the current scenario, setting data mining targets, and creating a project plan. 

### 2. Data Understanding
Data understanding provides the analytical foundation for a study by creating a summary and identifying potential problems in the data. It must also be carried out carefully and not in a rush, such as in data visualization, where sometimes the insight is very difficult to obtain when connected to the summary data. If there are problems at this step that have not been answered, it will interfere with the modeling step.

### 3. Data Preparation
The data is rarely clean. Data preparation focuses on cleaning and translating raw data into a modelable format. It includes: selecting data, cleaning data, constructing data (feature engineering), integrating data, and formatting data.

### 4. Modeling
With clean data at hand, numerous modeling strategies are used. Each approach may require specialized data formats, so it is not uncommon to return to the data preparation phase. Key activities include: selecting modeling techniques, designing tests, building the model, and evaluating the model.

### 5. Evaluation
Evaluation is used to analyze the outcomes of data mining generated during the preceding stage of the modeling process. This is done on the model used in the previous step, with the goal of ensuring that the model determined is consistent with the objectives set in the first step.

### 6. Deployment
The model is finally deployed in a real-world situation. This might be as easy as creating a report or as complicated as establishing a repeatable data mining process. The key activities include planning deployment, monitoring and maintenance, reviewing the project, and completing the project.

## Data Privacy Laws
### a. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
<img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/2bf260dd-1ca0-4563-ab94-5c7fdb1b57ee" width="550" height="300">

The GDPR is the most stringent privacy and security law in the world. The GDPR signals Europe's hard stance on data privacy and security at a time when more individuals are committing their personal data to cloud services and breaches are commonplace. GDPR compliance is a frightening prospect, especially for small and medium-sized organizations (SMEs), due to the regulation's scale, breadth, and relative lack of specificity.

The GDPR has several fundamental obligations, including:
- Consent

  Organizations must obtain consent before collecting personal data, and the amount of consent varies depending on the type of personal data being collected.
- Data minimization

  In response to years of gratuitous acquisition of personal data by apps without a clear purpose, the GDPR requires enterprises to gather only personal data that is clearly relevant to a well-defined business objective. If an entity collects personal data for one reason but subsequently decides to use it for another (such as consumer profiling), this may be termed noncompliance.
- Individual rights
  
  Another important aspect of the GDPR is the very specific rights that data subjects (i.e., the individuals whose personal data is being gathered) have to understand why their data is being collected and how it is being processed. They have the right to object, correct, and be wiped or forgotten. They also have the right to be notified (individually) if their personal information has been compromised in a way that threatens their freedoms and rights.
### b. FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
The FERPA is a federal statute that **safeguards the privacy of student educational records**. The statute applies to all schools that receive monies from the United States Department of Education under an applicable program.

FERPA gives parents some rights regarding their children's education records. These rights are transferred to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or enrolls in a school after high school. pupils with transferred rights are referred to as "eligible students."
### c. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
<img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/1562f953-1457-496c-8e85-193ac86947af" width="350" height="290">

HIPAA is a federal law in the United States that governs the privacy and security of health data. It was released on August 21, 1996. The HIPAA Privacy Rule sets national standards for **securing individual medical records and other personally identifiable health information**. It applies to health plans, health care institutions, and health care providers that perform certain health care transactions electronically. The rule mandates proper protections to preserve the privacy of protected health information, as well as limits and conditions on how such information may be used and disclosed without the individual's permission. Individuals also have rights to their protected health information under the regulations, such as the right to inspect and obtain copies of their health records, to direct covered entities to transmit electronic copies of their protected health information to third parties, and to request corrections.
### d. IRB (Institutional Review Board)
<img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/d40346e3-b0da-4e27-859c-59b670160bea" width="550" height="350">

An IRB is a panel appointed to **examine and manage scientific research involving human participants**. The IRB's principal responsibility is to defend the rights and well-being of research participants. They have the authority to approve, modify, or reject a study. The IRB was founded in compliance with FDA requirements, and its goal is to guarantee that sufficient precautions are made to protect research subjects' rights and welfare. To ensure proper protection of research participants' rights and welfare, IRB Boards conduct group reviews of protocols and other related materials. They also guarantee that research studies adhere to rules, accepted ethical standards, institutional policies, and safeguard study subjects.
### e. PCI (Payment Card Industry)
<img src="https://github.com/khanshafiira/Data-Visualization/assets/166186201/474b59f8-5448-4d7f-ac8c-0a2ed20e9ff7" width="400" height="250">

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) is a collection of security standards created by major credit card firms to help protect sensitive cardholder information. Unlike HIPAA and GDPR regulations, which are based on government law, **PCI-DSS compliance requirements are contractual commitments maintained and enforced by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)**, an independent multinational organization founded in 2006.PCI-DSS applies to any merchant or entity that accepts, transmits, or stores cardholder data. However, there are several PCI-DSS compliance levels based on how many payment transactions a merchant/organization has processed in the past twelve months.

## Data Handling
### 1. Handling PII
When dealing with PII in tiny data sets, it is critical to gather and store only the information required for the intended purpose. To limit the possibility of being identified, the data may be anonymized or pseudonymized.
### 2. Data Security Measures
Implement strong data protection mechanisms, such as encryption, access restriction, and frequent security audits. Even tiny data sets might be vulnerable to unauthorised access, making data security a top priority.
### 3. Anonymization Techniques
Data anonymisation is the process of deleting or changing personally identifiable information in order to safeguard an individual's privacy. Techniques such as generalisation, filtering, and perturbation can be used to anonymize tiny data sets while retaining part of their utility.
### 4. Importance of Data Anonymization
Anonymizing data is critical for protecting individual privacy rights, preserving trust, and adhering to data protection requirements such as GDPR. It helps to limit the likelihood of re-identification and unauthorized use of personal information.
### 5. Make a compromise between interpretability and accuracy
When balancing interpretability and accuracy in tiny data sets, there are tradeoffs to be made. Increasing data anonymisation and aggregation for privacy reasons may affect the accuracy of analysis and insights derived from the data.
### 6. Weaknesses of Generalizing at the Population Level with Limited Sample Data
Generalizing at the population level based on a small sample size may yield skewed or incorrect results. Small data sets may fail to appropriately represent the population's diversity and complexity, leading in erroneous generalization.

## Types of Bias that Affect Collection and Interpretation of Data
### a. Confirmation bias
This bias happens when people deliberately seek or interpret information in ways that confirm their pre-existing views or preconceptions. It might result in the selective acquisition or interpretation of data that supports one's beliefs while ignoring opposing evidence.
### b. Human Cognitive Bias
This encompasses a variety of biases resulting from the way the human brain processes information. Anchoring bias (over-reliance on the initial information encountered), availability bias (prioritizing information that is easily accessible), and novelty bias (paying more weight to recent occurrences or experiences) are some examples.
### 3. Motivational Bias
Motivational bias occurs when people purposefully or unintentionally distort data collection or interpretation to advance their personal or professional goals. These biases can be motivated by financial incentives, professional progress aspirations, or personal values.
### 4. Selection Bias in Data Visualisation and Representation
This bias can develop when certain visualisations or data representations are chosen to suit a specific narrative or agenda while disregarding or dismissing opposing viewpoints. For example, choosing just data points or visualisations that emphasize a desired outcome while omitting those that present a more balanced perspective.
